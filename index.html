              <p>I was born and rasied in Hong Kong and moved to the States when I was 14. I grew up in all girl's catholic school. We had to wear uniform to school, we cannot eat or drink in the classroom. We have to ask for permission to go to the bathroom and even walking to the front of the classroom to toss your garbage in the trash bin needs permission. </p>
              <p>My first day of school in the States was eye opening for me. Everyone dressed differently, some students had purple hair, some students were wearing their pajamas, and some students were wearing high heels. Every time I hear someone's heels clicking behind me, my first reaction was turn around and greet whoever is walking behind me. Since in my old school, only teachers can wear heels and we need to greet them properly, so it took me a while getting used to that. </p>
              <p>I remember the first time I witness a fight in the school cafeteria was terrifying for me. All the students around the fight did not try to stop it. The all stood there, some even put a chair on the lunch table and stand on the chair to get a better view of the fight. Students did not stop fighting until school administrator and police officers intervene.</p>
